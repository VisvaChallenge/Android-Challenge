# Android-Challenge

Create a Android app that consumes JSON data to populate a Table or List where you can click on a row to view extra details.

JSON Data from here: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos

example:
```
`{ albumId: 1, id: 1, title: "accusamus beatae ad facilis cum similique qui sunt", url: "http://placehold.it/600/92c952", thumbnailUrl: "http://placehold.it/150/30ac17" }`
```

Requirements: 
* Create a Table or List with rows that displays the image from the thumbnailUrl and title. 
* When row is clicked display the title and larger image from the url. 

Freedom to use any other 3rd party frameworks, but explain why you are using it.

Bonus: 
* Add searching by title. 
* Anything else you can think of...
